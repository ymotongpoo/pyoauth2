Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

pyoauth2 has been developed with a few principles, such as:

- simple interface
- explicit implemnetation
- readability

At the date of late April in 2012, we can find several OAuth related client libraries on `Python Package Index`_, but most of them are targetting on OAuth 1.0, not on OAuth 2.0. The most confusing fact is that OAuth 2.0's official client library introduction `page`_ is linking to `python-oauth2`_, which is not for OAuth 2.0 but OAuth 1.0 though its name includes "oauth2."

.. _Python Package Index: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
.. _python-oauth2: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth2/
.. _page: http://oauth.net/2/

In order to make a difference, I released this library as a starting point for users and welcome all contribution based on the principles above.
