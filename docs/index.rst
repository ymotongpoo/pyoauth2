pyoauth2: Simple OAuth 2.0 client
=================================

Release v\ |version|

pyoauth2 is a New BSD Licensed library, written in Python.

pyoauth2 provides simple `OAuth 2.0`_ client, which enables easy authorization to several web service APIs, such as Google APIs, Facebook API, Foursquare and so on. (Note that Twitter does not provide OAuth 2.0 as of now.)

This module tries to follow detailed specs on Internet-Draft of OAuth 2.0 (Candidate replacement of RFC 5849) but as of now it is implemented on a visceral level.   

.. _OAuth 2.0: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2
